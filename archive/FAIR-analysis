Measure capabilities of existing project structures using FAIR
Ayato Hisanaga // Seattle Bicycle Traffic Data Processing Project

Seattle Bicycle Traffic Predictor is a project currently in development aimed at leveraging ML techniques
to make daily cyclist traffic predictions for 14 sensor locations in and around Seattle, WA. The Seattle Bicycle
Traffic Data Processing Project addresses the critical need for useable data by collecting datasets from
Seattle Open Data via API and restructuring them to improve FAIRness. 

When the datasets are collected, a JSON file containing metadata for each dataset is produced. Several aspects of 
this metadata promote FAIR principles. For example, the metadata includes the original dataset identifier key used 
in Seattle's Open Data Portal, making it retrievable ('A1') and references other metadata ('I3'). The metadata also 
includes the title and a brief description in English, providing street or landmark names to provide rich details ('F3').
It also provides a direct web address to the Open Data source page for each dataset, providing relevant source information 
for the data ('R1'). Furthermore, to support the accessibility of the actual datasets themselves, the metadata contains
a short, English identifier ('fremont', 'greenway58', 'blanchard') that corresponds with the datasets stored in CSV 
format ('fremont.csv', 'greenway58.csv', 'blanchard.csv') ('I1'). To improve alignment with FAIR guidelines, the metadata
and processed datasets should be uploaded to an online repository such as GitHub, allowing them to be searchable ('F4').
