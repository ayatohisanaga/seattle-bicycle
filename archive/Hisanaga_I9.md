### Test Plan for Seattle Bicycle Traffic and Weather Data Information System

#### 1. **Functional Tests**

##### 1.1 Data Collection
- **API Endpoint Connectivity Test**: Verify connections to Seattle Open Data Bicycle Datasets.
  - **Method**: Use automated scripts to test endpoint responses.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (When public datasets are updated)
  - **Alarm**: I notice the script fails.
  - **Action**: Investigate and resolve endpoint issues.

- **Web Scraping Test**: Ensure web scraping scripts correctly collect weather data.
  - **Method**: Compare a sample of scraped data against the source.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Alarm**: I notice the script fails, possibly due to web page reformatting.
  - **Action**: Debug and update scraping scripts.

##### 1.2 Data Processing
- **ETL Process Validation Test**: Confirm that data is correctly extracted, transformed, and loaded.
  - **Method**: Check data integrity through unit tests and validation scripts.
  - **Frequency**: With each ETL run
  - **Alarm**: I notice the output is inconsistent with expectations.
  - **Action**: Roll back to the previous stable version and debug.

##### 1.3 API and Web Interface
- **API Functionality Test**: Ensure all API endpoints return the correct data.
  - **Method**: Manually test API endpoints to verify responses.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Alarm**: I notice the data being returned is inconsistent with expectations.
  - **Action**: Investigate and fix API issues.

- **UI/UX Test**: Validate UI for usability and responsiveness.
  - **Method**: User testing.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Alarm**: Manual review.
  - **Action**: Gather user feedback and make iterative improvements.

- **Folium Map Interaction Test**: Ensure interactive map functions correctly for location selection.
  - **Method**: Manual testing of each location.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Alarm**: I notice inconsistencies with expectations.
  - **Action**: Debug and fix interaction issues.

#### 2. **Performance Tests**

##### 2.1 Load Testing
- **API Load Test**: Assess API performance under high traffic.
  - **Method**: Use load testing tools (e.g., JMeter) to simulate traffic.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Alarm**: Manual review of response time and error rates.
  - **Action**: Optimize API code and scale infrastructure as needed (unlikely).

##### 2.2 Response Time Testing
- **Data Processing Time Test**: Measure the time taken for the ETL process.
  - **Method**: Monitor and log processing times.
  - **Frequency**: With each ETL run
  - **Alarm**: Print console message if processing time exceeds predefined limits.
  - **Action**: Identify bottlenecking and optimize data processing pipeline.

- **API Response Time Test**: Ensure API responds promptly.
  - **Method**: Take note of response times.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Alarm**: I notice the API does not respond promptly (add a time limit error message).
  - **Action**: Investigate and resolve performance bottlenecks.

##### 2.3 Reliability Testing
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Ensure high availability of the API and web interface.
  - **Method**: Use uptime monitoring services (e.g., UptimeRobot).
  - **Frequency**: Continuous
  - **Alarm**: Immediate alerts for downtime.
  - **Action**: Investigate and restore service promptly.

- **Data Consistency Check**: Regularly verify data consistency between sources and stored data.
  - **Method**: Automated consistency checks and audits.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Alarm**: Print console message(s) for any inconsistencies detected.
  - **Action**: Identify and correct data inconsistencies.

#### 3. **Maintenance and Ongoing Testing**

- **Routine Audits**: Conduct regular system audits to ensure all components function as expected.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Action**: Document findings and implement improvements.

- **User Feedback Loop**: Establish a mechanism for users to report issues and suggest improvements.
  - **Method**: Feedback forms or my email.
  - **Action**: Prioritize and address feedback in monthly update cycles.

- **Documentation Review**: Keep the test plan and system documentation up to date.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly (aligned with bicycle data updates)
  - **Action**: Revise documents to reflect any changes or improvements in the system.
